# Security, and what is actually hidden

## The threat

Someone wants to know which token ID holds the good piece, before it mints.

SeaDrop mints IDs in order, so a minter cannot choose their token ID. That does
not settle it: knowing the mapping lets you watch the supply climb and mint at
the moment the next ID is a rare one. The mapping is the secret, and timing is
the attack. Publishing your metadata directory to IPFS beforehand hands the
mapping over completely.

## What this server hides

Which artwork an unminted token ID will get. That is the whole claim.

## What it does not hide

The artwork itself. Your images can be public on IPFS, and normally are. An image
alone does not say which token ID it belongs to.

The rarity distribution. Anyone can read what has minted, count the traits, and
work out what is left. Every reveal scheme has this property.

Anything already revealed. Once a token mints its metadata is public and indexers
archive it immediately.

Your metadata set, if you publish it somewhere else. See the next section.

## The mistake to avoid

If your metadata set is readable in full and the mapping is sequential, the
gating here is decorative. Someone reads your set, counts positions, and knows
which token gets what.

Three ways that happens:

You push your copy of this repository somewhere public after running
`npm run build:manifest`, which writes every token's metadata into
`src/generated/manifest.ts`. `metadata/` is gitignored, but the generated file
cannot be, because the deployment needs it. So there is a guard instead:
`npm run check:privacy` fails if that file is staged or committed with entries in
it, it runs in CI, and `build:manifest` installs it as a pre-commit hook. Set
`ALLOW_METADATA_IN_GIT=1` to override it on a repository you know stays private,
or use `metadata.source: "r2"` so the metadata never enters git at all.

You pin the finished set to IPFS "just to have it ready". A pinned CID is a CID
anyone can fetch, whether or not you told them.

You set `metadata.source: "http"` with a base URL that is not actually private,
such as a public gateway or a bucket with listing enabled.

## The shuffle, and why you might want it

Turning on `reveal.shuffle` breaks the link between position in your set and
token ID. It buys two things.

Your metadata set can be public without giving away the mapping, because knowing
the set tells you nothing about which token gets which entry.

Holders can check you did not cheat. Before the mint you publish two hashes:

```
manifestHash   a hash of your complete metadata set
commitment     a hash of the secret seed
```

After the mint you publish the seed, and anyone can recompute the mapping and
confirm it produces what the server served. Without a commitment nothing stops a
creator reassigning the good pieces mid-mint, and nothing lets an honest creator
prove they did not. See [verify-a-shuffle.md](verify-a-shuffle.md).

```bash
npm run seed:new
```

Keep a copy of the seed somewhere other than the machine you are working on.
Losing it means you can never reveal: the server refuses to guess, because
guessing would serve the unshuffled order, which is both the wrong artwork and a
leak of the order the shuffle exists to hide.

## Secrets, and what each one can do

| Secret | If it leaks |
| --- | --- |
| `SHUFFLE_SEED` | Someone can compute the whole mapping, which is the thing you were hiding. Treat it like a private key until you publish it deliberately. |
| `ALCHEMY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Someone can reveal tokens earlier than you meant to. Nothing can be stolen and no mapping can change. |
| `RPC_URL` with an API key in it | Someone can spend your RPC quota. `/status` reports the host only, never the URL. |

None of these give anyone control of your contract. Nothing in this repository
holds or needs a wallet key. The one onchain action involved, `setBaseURI`, you
send yourself.

## Design choices that exist for safety

The mechanics are in [how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md); what they buy you is:

- It fails closed. No chain access, or a metadata source that errors, means the
  placeholder rather than a 500 or a guess. Failures make reveals late, never
  early.
- Artwork depends only on token ID, fixed before the mint. A reorg can reveal one
  token a few seconds early, and can never show the wrong artwork.
- A reveal is one way. The high water mark only rises, so a burn, a lagging RPC
  node, or a replayed webhook cannot un-reveal a token buyers have seen.
- Unrevealed responses are not cacheable, so no CDN can strand a placeholder on a
  token that has minted.
- `/status` and `/provenance` are safe to hand to anyone. Neither includes a
  secret, and the seed appears at `/provenance` only when you set
  `PUBLISH_SEED=true`.

## Reporting something

Open an issue, or for anything you would rather not post publicly, use GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting on this repository.

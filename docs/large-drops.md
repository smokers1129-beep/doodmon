The default setup compiles your metadata into the deployment, which is right up
to a few thousand tokens and stops being right somewhere above that.

`npm run build:manifest` tells you where you stand:

```
note  metadata JSON  4.10 MB
note  compressed     412 KB (what counts against a Workers bundle limit)
```

The compressed number is what matters. Cloudflare's worker bundle limit is 3 MB
free and 10 MB paid, and metadata JSON compresses about ten to one, so a 10,000
token set often still fits. The build warns at 70 percent of the free limit and
fails past it. Vercel and a plain Node process have no comparable limit.

## Option 1, Cloudflare R2

One object per position, read on demand, cached in memory after the first read.
Metadata never enters git, which removes the main way people accidentally publish
their unrevealed set.

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create my-drop-metadata
```

Uncomment the `r2_buckets` block in `wrangler.toml` and set the bucket name. Then
in `drop.config.ts`:

```ts
metadata: {
  source: "r2",
  pathTemplate: "{index}.json",
}
```

Upload your files, named by zero based position, so token 1 with
`tokenIdStart: 1` reads `0.json`:

```bash
for i in $(seq 0 9999); do
  npx wrangler r2 object put "my-drop-metadata/$i.json" --file "metadata/$((i + 1)).json"
done
```

That loop is slow for ten thousand files. `rclone` with an S3 remote pointed at
R2 is much faster, as is the R2 dashboard's bulk upload.

Set the manifest hash by hand if you want `/provenance` to report one, using the
value `npm run build:manifest` printed:

```ts
metadata: {
  source: "r2",
  manifestHash: "e2ce2f...",
}
```

R2 buckets are private unless you attach a public domain to them. Do not attach
one.

## Option 2, a private HTTP base URL

Any host you control, with an optional `Authorization` header:

```ts
metadata: { source: "http", pathTemplate: "{index}.json" }
```

```bash
METADATA_HTTP_BASE_URL=https://private.example.com/drop
METADATA_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=Bearer some-token
```

A private S3 or GCS bucket, or a small origin of your own, both work. A public
IPFS gateway does not: if the set is publicly readable and the shuffle is off,
the gating stops meaning anything ([security.md](security.md)).

## Option 3, keep bundling but shrink the JSON

Often the simplest fix. Long descriptions repeated across every token, or per
token `external_url` values, are usually most of the bytes.

## RPC load at scale

Independent of metadata size. The default `sequential` mode makes one chain read
per TTL window, whatever your traffic, so a 10,000 token drop costs the same as a
100 token one: roughly six calls a minute.

`ownerOf` mode does scale with distinct tokens requested, one call each, cached
permanently once positive. For a large drop indexed by several marketplaces at
once that is a real number of calls, so prefer `sequential` unless your contract
genuinely mints out of order.

## Cold starts

A serverless instance that has just started knows nothing, so its first request
waits for one RPC round trip, typically under a second, and each instance pays
that once. With a KV store bound, a new instance can read the shared high water
mark instead. See [webhooks.md](webhooks.md).

### The shuffle, on a very large drop

Building the permutation is one Fisher-Yates pass over `maxSupply` with BigInt
arithmetic, done lazily on the first reveal request an instance serves, once per
instance. Measured on Node 22:

| tokens  | first reveal |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 1,000   | ~6ms         |
| 10,000  | ~9ms         |
| 50,000  | ~16ms        |
| 100,000 | ~25ms        |

That is fine everywhere except one place: the Cloudflare **free** plan caps a
request at 10ms of CPU, and this is CPU, not waiting. Past roughly 10,000 tokens
the first reveal each new instance serves can be killed for exceeding it, and
because it is killed rather than caught, the caller gets a Cloudflare error page
instead of the placeholder this server would otherwise fail closed to. The next
request lands on a new instance and hits the same wall.

So above about 10,000 tokens with the shuffle on, use the Workers paid plan
(30s of CPU, so the cost disappears into the noise), or Vercel, or Node, none of
which have a comparable per-request cap. Turning the shuffle off removes the work
entirely: position maps straight to index, and nothing is built.

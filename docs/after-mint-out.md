You do not have to keep this running forever. Once every token is minted there is
nothing left to hide, so the sensible end state is the normal one: a pinned IPFS
directory with the contract pointing at it.

## Option 1, hand the collection back to IPFS

The recommended path. Nothing depends on your server afterwards.

```bash
npm run export
```

That writes one file per token to `out/`, named after the token ID with no
extension, which is what `tokenURI` expects. The shuffle, if you used one, is
already applied, so the files match what the server has been serving.

Pin the directory:

```bash
ipfs add -r --cid-version 1 out
```

Or upload it through Pinata, web3.storage, Filebase, or whatever you already use.

Check a token resolves through a gateway before changing anything onchain:

```bash
curl -s https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>/1 | head
```

Compare it to what your server serves for the same token. They should be
identical:

```bash
diff <(curl -s https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>/1) <(curl -s https://your-server/1)
```

Then point the contract at the CID, from the owner wallet, with the trailing
slash:

```bash
cast send <contract> "setBaseURI(string)" "ipfs://<cid>/" \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $KEY
```

Ask OpenSea to re-read the tokens, since the URI changed:

```bash
OPENSEA_API_KEY=... npm run refresh
```

Leave the server up for a day or two while indexers catch up, then switch it off.

## Option 2, leave the server running

Fine too, and simpler. Set the reveal switch so nothing depends on chain reads:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put REVEAL_ALL   # value: true
```

Every token is then served immediately, and the server stops calling your RPC
endpoint entirely.

The trade is that your collection's metadata now depends on a server you
maintain, a domain you keep renewing, and an account in good standing. Collectors
prefer IPFS for that reason. If you go this way, use a domain you control rather
than a `*.workers.dev` or `*.vercel.app` hostname, so you can move hosts later
without touching the contract.

## Publishing the seed, if you used a shuffle

Do this once minting is finished, so holders can verify the mapping:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put PUBLISH_SEED   # value: true
```

`/provenance` then serves the seed alongside the commitment you published before
the mint, and anyone can recompute the mapping. See
[verify-a-shuffle.md](verify-a-shuffle.md), and post the seed wherever you
announced the drop rather than only at an endpoint.

If you pin to IPFS, `npm run export -- --include-seed` puts the seed in
`out/provenance.json` as well, making the record permanent. That file is public
and forever, so it is opt in.

## If the drop never mints out

Common enough, and nothing breaks. Unminted tokens keep returning the placeholder
indefinitely, which is the correct answer: they do not exist.

To make the remaining tokens look finished rather than pending after closing a
mint early, edit the placeholder in `drop.config.ts` and redeploy.

## What to check before switching the server off

Does `tokenURI` return the IPFS URI, for a few different token IDs.

Does a gateway serve each of those without a long delay on first fetch.

Does OpenSea show the artwork, on tokens sampled across the range rather than
only token 1.

Is anything else pointing at the server: a custom `contractURI`, your own site, a
Discord bot, an analytics job. Those are easy to forget and break quietly.
